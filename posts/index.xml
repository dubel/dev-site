      <description>The Year was 1998 (or so) - Your humble servant was merely scratching the surface of programming landscape. I&amp;rsquo;ve started my journey by writing some BASIC programs&amp;hellip; on a sheet of paper. Couple months later I&amp;rsquo;ve switched to Pascal.
Those memories were brought to live when charity campaign #code16challenge was launched. Whole IT community was posting code snippets and sharing fundraising (for expensive treatment of 10 months old Maja). I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to dust my Pascal knowledge off and see if I can put together few lines of code.</description>
